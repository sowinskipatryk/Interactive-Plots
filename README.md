# Interactive Plots

In this repo, I am testing three methods of achieving interactive plots that disable/enable the selected characteristic when clicked on a button/legend box.

Of the three - matplotlib events, plotly and ipywidgets package - the first of the above turned out to be the best for my use case. Plotly adds a nice design, but with more data it caused the jupyter notebook to lag.
Meanwhile, ipywidgets has buttons and check boxes that get the job done however, turning off characteristics from the legend box level seems subjectively more appealing.
